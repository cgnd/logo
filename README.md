# Common Ground Electronics Logo

The logo is generated by a Python script using the [svg.py](https://github.com/orsinium-labs/svg.py) library. The dependencies are specified in the script itself using [PEP 722](https://peps.python.org/pep-0722/) syntax which allows it to be run directly by tools like [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) that support PEP 722.

## Generating the SVG

First, install `uv` by following the installation guide at https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

Next, run the script to generate the SVG file:

```bash
uv run cgnd_logo.py > cgnd_logo.svg
```
